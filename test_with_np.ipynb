    "## 3) Compute similarity using Min-hash signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we defined two classes, `User` and `Signatures`, along with their methods. Below's an explanation of what each class and method does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `User` class:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `User` object with a `user` identifier and a `num` parameter. It also creates a NumPy array called `user_signature` with `num` elements (the number of hash functions), initialized to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Signatures` class:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `Signatures` object with a `num` parameter (the number of hash functions) and an `R` parameter (R a large enough prime number). It also initializes other attributes such as `a`, `b`, and `R`, for the hash function, `combination` as a set to make sure that each hash function uses different values of a,b pairs, and `list_approx` list for storing pairs that have estimated similarity at least 50%.\n",
    "   - The `convert` method is a hash function that maps each element `x` to a value based on the hash parameters `a`, `b`, and `R`. It returns the minimum value obtained from the hash calculation i.e., the min-hash value.\n",
    "   - The `create_sig` method creates user signatures for a given `grouped` object. It initializes a list of `User` objects called `listofusers`, where each `User` object is assigned a unique identifier. It iterates `num` times and generates random hash parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the hash values for each user in `grouped` using the `convert` method and assigns the minimum hash value to the corresponding `User` object's `user_signature` array.\n",
    "   - The `assess_similarity` method compares the user signatures of each pair of users in `listofusers`. If the similarity, defined as the ratio of matching elements in the user signatures, is greater than or equal to 0.5, the pair is added to the `list_approx`.\n",
    "   - The `LSH_similarity_evaluations` method evaluates the similarity between users using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). It reshapes the user signatures 2-D array into a new 3-D array by splitting an array of (users * total number of hash functions) into (users * `bands` groups * `r` hash functions) and iterates over the pairs of users. It compares the rows of the reshaped array and if there is a match, it adds the pair to the `list_approx` and adds one to the variable `summ` responsible for counting the candidate pairs.\n",
    "   - The `calculate_false` method calculates false positives and false negatives by comparing the `list_approx` with the actual positive Pairs stored in the `list_exact` variable.\n",
    "   - The `calculate_true` method calculates true positives by comparing the `list_approx` with the forementioned `list_exact` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The `LSH_similarity_evaluations` and `calculate_true`methods will be used for answering the fourth task."

    "\n",
    "11. After the outer loop completes, the value of `best_R` is printed, which represents the `R` value that resulted in the smallest sum of false positives and false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For random seed 1, we found the R with the lowest average (on 5 runs) sum of false positive and negative to be 4,003 and commented out the for loop iterating over the range of prime numbers in order for the code to have a faster run time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we reached to the conclusion that increasing the number of hash functions in min-hashing tends to reduce the false positive rate but does not directly impact false negatives. The choice of the number of hash functions should be based on the desired trade-off between accuracy, computational complexity, and the acceptable false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "False negatives in min-hashing depend on the similarity threshold used for identifying similar pairs of users. The number of hash functions in min-hashing affects the accuracy and false positive rate but not the false negatives. Choosing an appropriate similarity threshold is crucial for minimizing false negatives in min-hashing."

    "## 4) Locate similar users using LSH index\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we defined a function named `LSH` that performs Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for approximate similarity evaluation between users. Here's a summary of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It takes several parameters: `num` (number of hash functions), `b` (number of bands), `R` (large prime number), `grouped` (grouped per user ratings data), and `list_exact` (exact similarity pairs).\n",
    "2. The code initializes variables for counting true positives and total similarity evaluations to zero.\n",
    "3. The code enters a loop that iterates five times to perform LSH evaluation.\n",
    "4. Within each iteration:\n",
    "   * A new instance `c` of the `Signatures` class is created with `num` and `R`.\n",
    "   * The method `create_sig` is called on `c` to create user signatures using the `grouped` ratings data.\n",
    "   * The method `LSH_similarity_evaluations` is called on `c` with `b` number of bands to find and count the number of predicted positive pairs i.e., the similarity evaluations that will be performed using the initial representations.\n",
    "   * The number of true positives is calculated using the `calculate_true` method of `c` with `list_exact`.\n",
    "   * The number of true pairs returned (true positives) and the number of candidate pairs for similarity evaluation (predicted positives) are accumulated for averaging.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "5. After the loop, the averages of true and predicted positives are printed."

    "Using LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing), instead of directly comparing users on their true representations, offers a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Here are the gains and losses associated with using LSH:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gains:\n",
    "1. Efficiency: LSH allows for efficient similarity evaluation by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons required. It achieves this by using hash functions to group similar items together, allowing for faster identification of potential matches. As we reported above, even on the latter case that the number of similarity evaluations increased, it never reached the total number of similarity evaluations performed using the initial representations which is 444,153 (943*942/2).\n",
    "2. Scalability: LSH is particularly beneficial in scenarios with large datasets and high-dimensional data. It significantly reduces the computational burden compared to direct pairwise comparisons, making it more scalable for large-scale applications.\n",
    "3. Reduced Memory Usage: LSH typically requires storing only the compact hash signatures of the items rather than their full representations. This leads to lower memory requirements, which can be advantageous when dealing with memory-constrained systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Losses:\n",
    "1. Approximation: LSH introduces an element of approximation. It may classify some dissimilar pairs as similar (false positives) or fail to identify some similar pairs (false negatives). The degree of approximation depends on the chosen parameters and the nature of the data. Therefore, LSH is not guaranteed to provide exact similarity results. As we reported above, even on the latter case that the number of true positive pairs increased, it did not reach the actual number of true pairs which is 10.\n",
    "2. Quality of Similarity: The similarity measured through LSH is often a proximity measure rather than an exact representation. It relies on the choice of hash functions and the number of hash tables used, which can impact the quality of similarity assessments. This may lead to slightly different similarity rankings compared to the true representations.\n",
    "3. Sensitivity to Parameters: LSH performance is influenced by the selection of parameters such as the number of hash functions and the number of bands and thus it involves a trade-off. As we reported previously, as we were increasing the bands, true positives were increasing, but the same happened to the false positives too (number of similarity evaluations minus the true positives). Thus, choosing inappropriate parameters can result in decreased accuracy or efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, LSH offers significant gains in terms of computational efficiency and scalability compared to direct comparisons. However, it introduces an approximation factor and may yield slightly different similarity results. The suitability of LSH depends on the specific application requirements, the acceptable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and the characteristics of the dataset."
